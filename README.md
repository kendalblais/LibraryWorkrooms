CPSC 471 Project
Kendal Blais and Evan Hampton
Assigned TA: Animesh Gupta

To run this system, open the project file in Visual Studio. Ensure you have all of the
necessary assemblies referenced. Also, ensure that you've replaced the password in AbstractDatabase.cs
with your own root database password. Once this is done, the system can be run (in Debug
or Release mode) by using the run button on the top tool bar with the preferred browser.
